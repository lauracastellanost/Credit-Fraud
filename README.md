Decision Tree, Naive Mayes, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Artifical Neural Networks (ANN) were used in order to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions based on their characteristics. In the case of XGBoost, it is an ensemble algorithm that combines multiple models to achieve higher accuracy in fraud detection.
